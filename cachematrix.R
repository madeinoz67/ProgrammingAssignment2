## Two functions used to calculate the inverse of a matrix


## function: makeCacheMatrix
##  Purpose:    Creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse
## 
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## function: cacheSolve
##  Purpose:    Calculates the inverse of a matrix.
##              If the inverse has already been calculated 
##              (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve will 
##              retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## 
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
